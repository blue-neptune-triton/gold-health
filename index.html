    <h2>About Our Clinic</h2>
    <p>Gold Health is dedicated to offering access to regenerative therapies within Mexico’s regulated research framework. Our team of board‑certified physicians and scientists has decades of experience working with advanced biologics and follows ethically approved protocols reviewed by independent committees and COFEPRIS.</p>
    <p>We strive to provide a welcoming environment, transparent information, and compassionate care to everyone who visits our clinic.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Regenerative Therapy</h2>
    <p>Regenerative therapies harness cells that are being studied for their potential to support the body’s natural repair processes. Researchers are exploring how mesenchymal stem cells may help modulate inflammation and encourage tissue restoration under clinical supervision.</p>
    <p>At Gold Health, these therapies are offered within observational studies or approved research protocols. Individual experiences vary, and there are no guaranteed outcomes.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Why Mexico?</h2>
    <p><strong>Regulatory Framework:</strong> Mexico requires stem cell procedures to take place within sanctioned research protocols reviewed by independent ethics committees and sanctioned by COFEPRIS. The 2016 biotechnology standards enforce rigorous quality control measures including cell viability, sterility and potency testing.</p>
    <p><strong>Cost &amp; Access:</strong> Medical care in Mexico can be significantly more affordable than in the U.S. while maintaining high standards. Short travel times from North America and bilingual staff make visits convenient.</p>
    <p><strong>Experience:</strong> Our clinic employs physicians trained in the U.S., Canada or Europe and offers modern facilities, adhering to ethical sourcing and traceability requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Cultural Experience:</strong> Enjoy rest and recovery in a warm, welcoming environment along Mexico’s beautiful coast.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Safety, Ethics &amp; Compliance</h2>
    <p>We operate within Mexico’s legal and ethical framework. Article 327 prohibits commercialization of organs, tissues or cells, and Article 330 permits stem cell transplants only after scientific evaluation of risks and benefits. Our therapies are offered only under approved research protocols and observational studies.</p>
    <p>The 2016 biotechnology standards require testing for cell viability, sterility and potency. We use ethically sourced autologous or allogeneic cells with full traceability and quality assurance. All procedures are performed by licensed physicians, and we encourage patients to consult their primary healthcare providers before participating.</p>
